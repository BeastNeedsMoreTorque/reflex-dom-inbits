# reflex-dom-inbits

This repository is a beginner-friendly tutorial to get started with reflex-dom. 
It contains an introductionary text and examples in short bits. 

Reflex-Dom is a library to create Haskell applications with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
The GUI is based on the popular Document Object Model that is used in the Internet Browsers.
Therefore Reflex-Dom programs can be run in the Web Browser or as a Webkit-Gtk application. 

Reflex-dom is based on reflex, a Haskell implementation of Functional Reactive Programming.

It's not necessary to be a Haskell guru to follow this tutorial. 
A basic understanding of Haskell and the concepts of *Functor*, *Applicative* and *Monad* is enough.
With Reflex-Dom you can write GUI applications in Haskell without understanding the concepts of
*State Monad* or *Monad Transformers*. Of course, the more experience you have, the easier it is.
