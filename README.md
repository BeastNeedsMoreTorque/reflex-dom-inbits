# reflex-dom-inbits

This is a beginner-friendly tutorial. It shows how to write Haskell programs  with a graphical user interface using *reflex-dom*.
It contains an introductionary text and examples in short bits.

Reflex-Dom is a library to create Haskell applications with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
The GUI is based on the popular Document Object Model (DOM) that is used in the Internet Browsers.
Therefore Reflex-Dom programs can be run in the Web Browser or as a Webkit-Gtk application. 

*Reflex-dom* is based on *Reflex*, a Haskell implementation of Functional Reactive Programming.

It's not necessary to be a Haskell guru to follow this tutorial. 
A basic understanding of Haskell and the concepts of *Functor*, *Applicative* and *Monad* is enough.
With Reflex-Dom you can write GUI applications in Haskell without understanding the concepts of
*State Monad* or *Monad Transformers*. You should also have a basic background on *HTML* and 
on *Cascaded Style Sheets* (*CSS*). Of course, the more experience you have, the easier it is.

This tutorial is work in progres, it's not yet complete! I'll add more text with more examples in the near future.
