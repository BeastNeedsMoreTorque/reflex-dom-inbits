# reflex-dom-inbits

This is a very preliminary, drafty and raw version of an upcoming tutorial about reflex-dom.
I'll add more code examples and more tutorial text in the future...

This repository is a tutorial to get started with reflex-dom. 
It contains an introductionary text and examples in short bits.

Reflex-Dom is a library to create Haskell applications with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
The GUI is based on the popular Document Object Model that is used in the Internet Browsers.
Therefore Reflex-Dom programs can be run in the Web Browser or as a Webkit-Gtk application. 

Reflex-dom is based on reflex, a Haskell implementation of Functional Reactive Programming.

It's not necessary to be a Haskell guru to follow this tutorial. 
A basic understanding of Haskell and the concepts of *Functor*, *Applicative* and *Monad* is enough. 
Of course, the more experience you have, the easier it is.
